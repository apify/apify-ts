title: Skipping navigations for certain requests

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import ApiLink from '@site/src/components/ApiLink';
import SkipNavigationSource from '!!raw-loader!./skip-navigation.ts';

While crawling a website, you may encounter certain resources you'd like to save, but don't need the full power of a crawler to do so (like images delivered through a CDN).

By combining the <ApiLink to="core/class/Request#skipNavigation">`Request#skipNavigation`</ApiLink> option with <ApiLink to="basic-crawler/interface/BasicCrawlingContext#sendRequest">`sendRequest`</ApiLink>, we can fetch the image from the CDN, and save it to our key-value store without needing to use the full crawler.


:::info

For this example, we are using the <ApiLink to="puppeteer-crawler/class/PuppeteerCrawler">`PuppeteerCrawler`</ApiLink> to showcase this, but this is available on all the crawlers we provide.

<CodeBlock className="language-js">

</CodeBlock>
