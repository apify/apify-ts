You don't need to worry about this anymore, as the context-aware `enqueueLinks` method handles base urls automatically

:::

If a website uses relative links, <VersionedApiLink apiPath="cheerio-crawler">`CheerioCrawler`</VersionedApiLink> and `enqueueLinks()` may have trouble following them. This is
why it is important to set the `baseUrl` property within `enqueueLinks()` to `request.loadedUrl`:

<CodeBlock className="language-js">
	{CrawlSource}
</CodeBlock>
