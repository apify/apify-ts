import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import VersionedApiLink from '@site/src/components/VersionedApiLink';
import BasicCrawlerSource from '!!raw-loader!./basic_crawler.ts';

This is the most bare-bones example of the Apify SDK, which demonstrates some of its building blocks such as the <VersionedApiLink apiPath="basic-crawler">`BasicCrawler`</VersionedApiLink>.
You probably don't need to go this deep though, and it would be better to start with one of the full featured crawlers
like [`CheerioCrawler`](../cheerio/cheerio-crawler) or [`PlaywrightCrawler`](../playwright/playwright-crawler).

The script simply downloads several web pages with plain HTTP requests using the <VersionedApiLink apiPath="utils/function/requestAsBrowser">`requestAsBrowser()`</VersionedApiLink>
convenience function and stores their raw HTML and URL in the default dataset. In local configuration, the data will be stored as JSON files in
`./apify_storage/datasets/default`.

<CodeBlock className="language-js">
	{BasicCrawlerSource}
</CodeBlock>
