Without the right tools, crawling and scraping the web can be difficult. At the very least, you need an HTTP client to make the necessary requests, but that only gets you raw HTML and sometimes not even that. Then you have to read this HTML and extract the data you're interested in. Once extracted, it must be stored in a machine-readable format and easily accessible for further processing, because it is the processed data that holds value.

Crawlee covers the process end-to-end. From crawling the web for links and scraping the raw data to storing it in various machine-readable formats, ready for processing. With this guide in hand, you should have your own data extraction solutions up and running in a few hours.

The goal of this guide is to provide a step-by-step introduction to all the features of Crawlee. It will walk you through creating the simplest of crawlers that only prints text to console, all the way up to complex systems that crawl pages, interact with them as if a real user were sitting in front of a real browser and output structured data.
