Running headless browsers in Docker requires a lot of setup to do it right. But there's no need to worry about that, because we already created base images that can now be freely used. We use them every day on the [Apify Platform](./apify-platform).

All images can be found in their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/apify/apify-actor-docker) and in our [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/apify).

## Overview

Browsers are pretty big, so we try to provide a wide variety of images to suit the specific needs. Here's a full list of our Docker images.

- [`apify/actor-node`](#actor-node)
- [`apify/actor-node-puppeteer-chrome`](#actor-node-puppeteer-chrome)
- [`apify/actor-node-playwright`](#actor-node-playwright)
- [`apify/actor-node-playwright-chrome`](#actor-node-playwright-chrome)
- [`apify/actor-node-playwright-firefox`](#actor-node-playwright-firefox)
- [`apify/actor-node-playwright-webkit`](#actor-node-playwright-webkit)

## Versioning

Each image is tagged with up to 2 version tags, depending on the type of the image. One for Node.js version and second for pre-installed web automation library version. If we use the image name without a version tag, we'll always get the latest available version.

> We recommend always using at least the Node.js version tag in the production Dockerfiles. It will ensure that a future update of Node.js will not break our automations.

### Node.js versioning

Our images are built with multiple Node.js versions to ensure backwards compatibility. Currently, Node.js versions 14, 15 and 16 are supported. To select the preferred version, the appropriate number as the image tag should be used.

```dockerfile
# Use Node.js 14
FROM apify/actor-node:14
```

```dockerfile
# Use Node.js 16
FROM apify/actor-node-playwright:16
```

### Automation library versioning

Images that include a pre-installed automation library, which means all images that include `puppeteer` or `playwright` in their name, are also tagged with the pre-installed version of the library. For example, `apify/actor-node-puppeteer-chrome:16-13.7.0` comes with Node.js 16 and Puppeteer v13.7.0. If we try to install a different version of Puppeteer into this image, we may run into compatibility issues, because the Chromium version bundled with `puppeteer` will not match the version of Chrome we pre-installed.

Similarly `apify/actor-node-playwright-firefox:14-1.21.1` runs on Node.js 14 and is pre-installed with the Firefox version that comes with v1.21.1.

Installing `apify/actor-node-puppeteer-chrome` (without a tag) will install the latest available version of Node.js and `puppeteer`.

### Pre-release tags

We also build pre-release versions of the images to test the changes we make. Those are typically denoted by a `beta` suffix, but it can vary depending on our needs. If we need to try a pre-release version, we can do it like this:

```dockerfile
# Without library version.
FROM apify/actor-node:16-beta
```

```dockerfile
# With library version.
FROM apify/actor-node-playwright-chrome:16-1.10.0-beta
```

## Best practices

- Node.js version tag should **always** be used.
- The automation library version tag should be used for **added security**.
- Asterisk `*` should be used as the automation library version in our `package.json` files.

It makes sure the pre-installed version of Puppeteer or Playwright is not re-installed on build. This is important, because those libraries are only guaranteed to work with specific versions of browsers, and those browsers come pre-installed in the image.

```dockerfile
FROM apify/actor-node-playwright-chrome:16
```

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "apify": "^3.0.0",
        "@crawlee/playwright": "^3.0.0",
        "playwright": "*"
    }
}
```

### Warning about image size

Browsers are huge. If we don't need them all in our image, it's better to use a smaller image with only the one browser we need.

We should also be careful when installing new dependencies. Nothing prevents us from installing Playwright into the`actor-node-puppeteer-chrome` image, but the resulting image will be about 3 times larger and extremely slow to download and build.

When we use only what we need, we'll be rewarded with reasonable build and start times.

## Apify Docker Images

### actor-node

This is the smallest image we have based on Alpine Linux. It does not include any browsers, and it's therefore best used with <ApiLink to="cheerio-crawler/class/CheerioCrawler">`CheerioCrawler`</ApiLink>. It benefits from lightning fast builds and container startups.

&#8203;<ApiLink to="puppeteer-crawler/class/PuppeteerCrawler">`PuppeteerCrawler`</ApiLink>, <ApiLink to="playwright-crawler/class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink> and other browser based features will **NOT** work with this image.

```dockerfile
FROM apify/actor-node:16
```

### actor-node-puppeteer-chrome

This image includes Puppeteer (Chromium) and the Chrome browser. It can be used with <ApiLink to="cheerio-crawler/class/CheerioCrawler">`CheerioCrawler`</ApiLink> and <ApiLink to="puppeteer-crawler/class/PuppeteerCrawler">`PuppeteerCrawler`</ApiLink>, but **NOT** with <ApiLink to="playwright-crawler/class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink>.

The image supports XVFB by default, so we can run both `headless` and `headful` browsers with it.

```dockerfile
FROM apify/actor-node-puppeteer-chrome:16
```

### actor-node-playwright

A very large and slow image that can run all Playwright browsers: Chromium, Chrome, Firefox, WebKit. Everything is installed. If we need to develop or test with multiple browsers, this is the image to choose, but in most cases, it's better to use the specialized images below.

```dockerfile
FROM apify/actor-node-playwright:16
```

### actor-node-playwright-chrome

Similar to [`actor-node-puppeteer-chrome`](#actor-node-puppeteer-chrome), but for Playwright. We can run <ApiLink to="cheerio-crawler/class/CheerioCrawler">`CheerioCrawler`</ApiLink> and <ApiLink to="playwright-crawler/class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink>, but **NOT** <ApiLink to="puppeteer-crawler/class/PuppeteerCrawler">`PuppeteerCrawler`</ApiLink>.

It uses the [`PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/environment-variables/) environment variable to block installation of more browsers into our images (to keep them small). If we want more browsers, either the [`actor-node-playwright`](#actor-node-playwright) image should be chosen or this env var should be overridden.

The image supports XVFB by default, so we can run both `headless` and `headful` browsers with it.

```dockerfile
FROM apify/actor-node-playwright-chrome:16
```

### actor-node-playwright-firefox

Same idea as [`actor-node-playwright-chrome`](#actor-node-playwright-chrome), but with Firefox
pre-installed.

```dockerfile
FROM apify/actor-node-playwright-firefox:16
```

### actor-node-playwright-webkit

Same idea as [`actor-node-playwright-chrome`](#actor-node-playwright-chrome), but with WebKit
pre-installed.

```dockerfile
FROM apify/actor-node-playwright-webkit:16
```

## Example Dockerfile

To use the above images, it's necessary to have a [`Dockerfile`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). We can either use this example, or bootstrap our projects with the [Crawlee CLI](../introduction/setting-up) which automatically adds the correct Dockerfile into our project folder.

    <TabItem value="js" label="For JavaScript Projects">

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="ts" label="For TypeScript Projects">
