This short tutorial will set us up to start using Crawlee in a minute or two,
while [Getting Started](../guides/getting-started) is a comprehensive step-by-step guide for creating the first scraper.
So let's check out this page first and then proceed to the latter to learn more.

## Local stand-alone usage

Crawlee requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 16 or later.
It can be added to any Node.js project by running:

<Tabs groupId="quick_start">
<TabItem value="cheerio" label="CheerioCrawler" default>
<CodeBlock language="bash">npm install crawlee</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="playwright" label="PlaywrightCrawler">
<CodeBlock language="bash">npm install crawlee playwright</CodeBlock>

:::caution

`playwright` is not bundled with Crawlee to reduce install size and allow greater flexibility - thus we need to explicitly install it with NPM.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="puppeteer" label="PuppeteerCrawler">
<CodeBlock language="bash">npm install crawlee puppeteer</CodeBlock>

:::caution

`puppeteer` is not bundled with Crawlee to reduce install size and allow greater flexibility - thus we need to explicitly install it with NPM.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We could run the following example to perform a recursive crawl of a website using:

<Tabs groupId="quick_start">
    <TabItem value="cheerio" label="CheerioCrawler" default>
        <CodeBlock language="js" title="src/main.mjs">{CheerioSource}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="playwright" label="PlaywrightCrawler">
        <CodeBlock language="js" title="src/main.mjs">{PlaywrightSource}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="puppeteer" label="PuppeteerCrawler">
        <CodeBlock language="js" title="src/main.mjs">{PuppeteerSource}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When we run the example, we should see Crawlee automating the data extraction process.

<Tabs groupId="quick_start">
<TabItem value="cheerio" label="CheerioCrawler" default>

[//]: # (TODO: Add CheerioCrawler gif here.)
![Chrome Scrape](/img/chrome_scrape.gif)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="playwright" label="PlaywrightCrawler">

[//]: # (TODO: Add PlaywrightCrawler gif here.)
![Chrome Scrape](/img/chrome_scrape.gif)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="puppeteer" label="PuppeteerCrawler">

![Chrome Scrape](/img/chrome_scrape.gif)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

By default, Crawlee stores data to `./crawlee_storage` in the current working directory. We can override this behavior by setting the `CRAWLEE_STORAGE_DIR` environment variable.

More examples showcasing various features of Crawlee could be found in [Examples](../examples) section of the documentation.

## Local usage with Crawlee command-line interface (CLI)

To create a boilerplate of our project, we can use the [Crawlee CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@crawlee/cli) tool by running:

```bash
npx crawlee create my-cheerio-crawler
```

The CLI will prompt us to select a project boilerplate template - let's just pick `Crawlee cheerio template [ts]`. The tool will create a directory called `my-cheerio-crawler` with a Node.js project files. We can run the project as follows:

```bash
cd my-cheerio-crawler
crawlee run
```

Or even:

```bash
cd my-cheerio-crawler
npm start
```

By default, the crawling data will be stored in a local directory at `./crawlee_storage`. For example, the input JSON file for the actor is expected to be in the default key-value store in `./crawlee_storage/key_value_stores/default/INPUT.json`.
