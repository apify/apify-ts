/**
 * Represents a queue of URLs to crawl, which is used for deep crawling of websites
 * where you start with several URLs and then recursively
 * follow links to other pages. The data structure supports both breadth-first and depth-first crawling orders.
 *
 * Each URL is represented using an instance of the {@link Request} class.
 * The queue can only contain unique URLs. More precisely, it can only contain {@link Request} instances
 * with distinct `uniqueKey` properties. By default, `uniqueKey` is generated from the URL, but it can also be overridden.
 * To add a single URL multiple times to the queue,
 * corresponding {@link Request} objects will need to have different `uniqueKey` properties.
 *
 * Do not instantiate this class directly, use the
 * {@link Apify#openRequestQueue} function instead.
 *
 * `RequestQueue` is used by {@link BasicCrawler}, {@link CheerioCrawler}, {@link PuppeteerCrawler}
 * and {@link PlaywrightCrawler} as a source of URLs to crawl.
 * Unlike {@link RequestList}, `RequestQueue` supports dynamic adding and removing of requests.
 * On the other hand, the queue is not optimized for operations that add or remove a large number of URLs in a batch.
 *
 * `RequestQueue` stores its data either on local disk or in the Apify Cloud,
 * depending on whether the `APIFY_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` or `APIFY_TOKEN` environment variable is set.
 *
 * If the `APIFY_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` environment variable is set, the queue data is stored in
 * that directory in an SQLite database file.
 *
 * If the `APIFY_TOKEN` environment variable is set but `APIFY_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` is not, the data is stored in the
 * [Apify Request Queue](https://docs.apify.com/storage/request-queue)
 * cloud storage. Note that you can force usage of the cloud storage also by passing the `forceCloud`
 * option to {@link Apify#openRequestQueue} function,
 * even if the `APIFY_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` variable is set.
 *
 * **Example usage:**
 *
 * ```javascript
 * // Open the default request queue associated with the actor run
 * const queue = await Apify.openRequestQueue();
 *
 * // Open a named request queue
 * const queueWithName = await Apify.openRequestQueue('some-name');
 *
 * // Enqueue few requests
 * await queue.addRequest({ url: 'http://example.com/aaa' });
 * await queue.addRequest({ url: 'http://example.com/bbb' });
 * await queue.addRequest({ url: 'http://example.com/foo/bar' }, { forefront: true });
