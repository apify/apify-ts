/**
 * Represents a static list of URLs to crawl.
 * The URLs can be provided either in code or parsed from a text file hosted on the web.
 * `RequestList` is used by {@link BasicCrawler}, {@link CheerioCrawler}, {@link PuppeteerCrawler}
 * and {@link PlaywrightCrawler} as a source of URLs to crawl.
 *
 * Each URL is represented using an instance of the {@link Request} class.
 * The list can only contain unique URLs. More precisely, it can only contain `Request` instances
 * with distinct `uniqueKey` properties. By default, `uniqueKey` is generated from the URL, but it can also be overridden.
 * To add a single URL to the list multiple times, corresponding {@link Request} objects will need to have different
 * `uniqueKey` properties. You can use the `keepDuplicateUrls` option to do this for you when initializing the
 * `RequestList` from sources.
 *
 * Once you create an instance of `RequestList`, you need to call the {@link RequestList.initialize} function
 * before the instance can be used. After that, no more URLs can be added to the list.
 * Unlike {@link RequestQueue}, `RequestList` is static but it can contain even millions of URLs.
 * > Note that `RequestList` can be used together with `RequestQueue` by the same crawler.
 * > In such cases, each request from `RequestList` is enqueued into `RequestQueue` first and then consumed from the latter.
 * > This is necessary to avoid the same URL being processed more than once (from the list first and then possibly from the queue).
 * > In practical terms, such a combination can be useful when there is a large number of initial URLs,
 * > but more URLs would be added dynamically by the crawler.
 *
 * `RequestList` has an internal state where it stores information about which requests were already handled,
 * which are in progress and which were reclaimed. The state may be automatically persisted to the default
 * {@link KeyValueStore} by setting the `persistStateKey` option so that if the Node.js process is restarted,
 * the crawling can continue where it left off. The automated persisting is launched upon receiving the `persistState`
 * event that is periodically emitted by {@link events|Apify.events}.
 *
 * The internal state is closely tied to the provided sources (URLs). If the sources change on actor restart, the state will become corrupted and
 * `RequestList` will raise an exception. This typically happens when the sources is a list of URLs downloaded from the web.
 * In such case, use the `persistRequestsKey` option in conjunction with `persistStateKey`,
 * to make the `RequestList` store the initial sources to the default key-value store and load them after restart,
 * which will prevent any issues that a live list of URLs might cause.
 *
 * **Basic usage:**
 * ```javascript
 * // Use a helper function to simplify request list initialization.
 * // State and sources are automatically persisted. This is a preferred usage.
 * const requestList = await Apify.openRequestList('my-request-list', [
 *     'http://www.example.com/page-1',
 *     { url: 'http://www.example.com/page-2', method: 'POST', userData: { foo: 'bar' }},
 *     { requestsFromUrl: 'http://www.example.com/my-url-list.txt', userData: { isFromUrl: true } },
 * ]);
 * ```
 *
 * **Advanced usage:**
 * ```javascript
 * // Use the constructor to get more control over the initialization.
 * const requestList = new Apify.RequestList({
 *     sources: [
 *         // Separate requests
 *         { url: 'http://www.example.com/page-1', method: 'GET', headers: { ... } },
 *         { url: 'http://www.example.com/page-2', userData: { foo: 'bar' }},
 *
 *         // Bulk load of URLs from file `http://www.example.com/my-url-list.txt`
 *         // Note that all URLs must start with http:// or https://
 *         { requestsFromUrl: 'http://www.example.com/my-url-list.txt', userData: { isFromUrl: true } },
 *     ],
 *
 *     // Persist the state to avoid re-crawling which can lead to data duplications.
 *     // Keep in mind that the sources have to be immutable or this will throw an error.
 *     persistStateKey: 'my-state',

/**
 * Opens a request list and returns a promise resolving to an instance
 * of the {@link RequestList} class that is already initialized.
 *
 * {@link RequestList} represents a list of URLs to crawl, which is always stored in memory.
 * To enable picking up where left off after a process restart, the request list sources
 * are persisted to the key-value store at initialization of the list. Then, while crawling,
 * a small state object is regularly persisted to keep track of the crawling status.
 *
 * For more details and code examples, see the {@link RequestList} class.
 *
 * **Example usage:**
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const sources = [
 *     'https://www.example.com',
 *     'https://www.google.com',
 *     'https://www.bing.com'
 * ];
 *
 * const requestList = await Apify.openRequestList('my-name', sources);
 * ```
 *
 * @param listName
 *   Name of the request list to be opened. Setting a name enables the `RequestList`'s state to be persisted
 *   in the key-value store. This is useful in case of a restart or migration. Since `RequestList` is only
 *   stored in memory, a restart or migration wipes it clean. Setting a name will enable the `RequestList`'s
 *   state to survive those situations and continue where it left off.
 *
 *   The name will be used as a prefix in key-value store, producing keys such as `NAME-REQUEST_LIST_STATE`
 *   and `NAME-REQUEST_LIST_SOURCES`.
 *
 *   If `null`, the list will not be persisted and will only be stored in memory. Process restart
 *   will then cause the list to be crawled again from the beginning. We suggest always using a name.
 * @param sources
 *  An array of sources of URLs for the {@link RequestList}. It can be either an array of strings,
 *  plain objects that define at least the `url` property, or an array of {@link Request} instances.
 *
 *  **IMPORTANT:** The `sources` array will be consumed (left empty) after {@link RequestList} initializes.
 *  This is a measure to prevent memory leaks in situations when millions of sources are
 *  added.
 *
 *  Additionally, the `requestsFromUrl` property may be used instead of `url`,
 *  which will instruct {@link RequestList} to download the source URLs from a given remote location.
 *  The URLs will be parsed from the received response. In this case you can limit the URLs
 *  using `regex` parameter containing regular expression pattern for URLs to be included.
 *
 *  For details, see the {@link RequestListOptions.sources}
 * @param [options]
 *   The {@link RequestList} options. Note that the `listName` parameter supersedes
 *   the {@link RequestListOptions.persistStateKey} and {@link RequestListOptions.persistRequestsKey}
 *   options and the `sources` parameter supersedes the {@link RequestListOptions.sources} option.
