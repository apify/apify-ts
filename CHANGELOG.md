2.0.6 / 2021/08/27
====================
- Fix deprecation messages logged from `ProxyConfiguration` and `CheerioCrawler`.
- Update `got-scraping` to receive multiple improvements.

2.0.5 / 2021/08/24
====================
- Fix error handling in puppeteer crawler

2.0.4 / 2021/08/23
====================
- Use `sessionToken` with `got-scraping`

2.0.3 / 2021/08/20
====================
- **BREAKING IN EDGE CASES** - We removed `forceUrlEncoding` in `requestAsBrowser` because we found out that recent versions of the underlying HTTP client `got` already encode URLs and `forceUrlEncoding` could lead to weird behavior. We think of this as fixing a bug, so we're not bumping the major version.
- Limit `handleRequestTimeoutMillis` to max valid value to prevent Node.js fallback to `1`.
- Use `got-scraping@^3.0.1`
- Disable SSL validation on MITM proxie
- Limit `handleRequestTimeoutMillis` to max valid value

2.0.2 / 2021/08/12
====================
- Fix serialization issues in `CheerioCrawler` caused by parser conflicts in recent versions of `cheerio`.

====================
- Use `got-scraping` 2.0.1 until fully compatible.

2.0.0 / 2021/08/05
====================
- **BREAKING**: Require Node.js >=15.10.0 because HTTP2 support on lower Node.js versions is very buggy.
- **BREAKING**: Bump `cheerio` to `1.0.0-rc.10` from `rc.3`. There were breaking changes in `cheerio` between the versions so this bump might be breaking for you as well.
- Remove `LiveViewServer` which was deprecated before release of SDK v1.
- We no longer tag beta releases.

1.3.4 / 2021/08/04

====================
- Fix client `/v2` duplication in `apiBaseUrl`.

1.3.0 / 2021/07/11
====================

## Navigation hooks in `CheerioCrawler`

`CheerioCrawler` downloads the web pages using the `requestAsBrowser` utility function.
As opposed to the browser based crawlers that are automatically encoding the URLs, the
`requestAsBrowser` function will not do so. We either need to manually encode the URLs
via `encodeURI()` function, or set `forceUrlEncoding: true` in the `requestAsBrowserOptions`,
which will automatically encode all the URLs before accessing them.

> We can either use `forceUrlEncoding` or encode manually, but not both - it would
> result in double encoding and therefore lead to invalid URLs.

We can use the `preNavigationHooks` to adjust `requestAsBrowserOptions`:

```
preNavigationHooks: [
    (crawlingContext, requestAsBrowserOptions) => {
        requestAsBrowserOptions.forceUrlEncoding = true;
    }
]
```

## `Apify` class and `Configuration`

Adds two new named exports:

- `Configuration` class that serves as the main configuration holder, replacing explicit usage of
environment variables.
- `Apify` class that allows configuring the SDK. Env vars still have precedence over the SDK configuration.

When using the Apify class, there should be no side effects.
Also adds new configuration for WAL mode in `ApifyStorageLocal`.

As opposed to using the global helper functions like `main`, there is an alternative approach using `Apify` class.
It has mostly the same API, but the methods on `Apify` instance will use the configuration provided in the constructor.
Environment variables will have precedence over this configuration.

```js
const { Apify } = require('apify'); // use named export to get the class

const sdk = new Apify({ token: '123' });
console.log(sdk.config.get('token')); // '123'

// the token will be passed to the `call` method automatically
const run = await sdk.call('apify/hello-world', { myInput: 123 });
console.log(`Received message: ${run.output.body.message}`);
```

Another example shows how the default dataset name can be changed:

```js
const { Apify } = require('apify'); // use named export to get the class

const sdk = new Apify({ defaultDatasetId: 'custom-name' });
await sdk.pushData({ myValue: 123 });
```

is equivalent to:
```js
const Apify = require('apify'); // use default export to get the helper functions

const dataset = await Apify.openDataset('custom-name');
await dataset.pushData({ myValue: 123 });
```

## Full list of changes:
- Add `Configuration` class and `Apify` named export, see above.
- Fix `proxyUrl` without a port throwing an error when launching browsers.
- Fix `maxUsageCount` of a `Session` not being persisted.
- Update `puppeteer` and `playwright` to match stable Chrome (90).
- Fix support for building TypeScript projects that depend on the SDK.
- add `taskTimeoutSecs` to allow control over timeout of `AutoscaledPool` tasks
- add `forceUrlEncoding` to `requestAsBrowser` options
- add `preNavigationHooks` and `postNavigationHooks` to `CheerioCrawler`
- deprecated `prepareRequestFunction` and `postResponseFunction` methods of `CheerioCrawler`
- Added new event `aborting` for handling gracefully aborted run from Apify platform.

1.2.1 / 2021/05/14
====================
- Fix `requestAsBrowser` behavior with various combinations of `json`, `payload` legacy options.

1.2.0 / 2021/05/10
====================
This release brings the long awaited HTTP2 capabilities to `requestAsBrowser`. It could make HTTP2 requests even before, but it was not very helpful in making browser-like ones. This is very important for disguising as a browser and reduction in the number of blocked requests. `requestAsBrowser` now uses [`got-scraping`](https://github.com/apify/got-scraping).

The most important new feature is that the full set of headers `requestAsBrowser` uses will now be generated using live data about browser headers that we collect. This means that the "header fingeprint" will always match existing browsers and should be indistinguishable from a real browser request. The header sets will be automatically rotated for you to further reduce the chances of blocking.

We also switched the default HTTP version from 1 to 2 in `requestAsBrowser`. We don't expect this change to be breaking, and we took precautions, but we're aware that there are always some edge cases, so please let us know if it causes trouble for you.

## Full list of changes:
- Replace the underlying HTTP client of `utils.requestAsBrowser()` with `got-scraping`.
- Make `useHttp2` `true` by default with `utils.requestAsBrowser()`.
- Fix `Apify.call()` failing with empty `OUTPUT`.
- Update `puppeteer` to `8.0.0` and `playwright` to `1.10.0` with Chromium 90 in Docker images.
- Update `@apify/ps-tree` to support Windows better.
- Update `@apify/storage-local` to support Node.js 16 prebuilds.

1.1.2 / 2021/04/10
====================
- **DEPRECATED:** `utils.waitForRunToFinish` please use the `apify-client` package and its `waitForFinish` functions. Sorry, forgot to deprecate this with v1 release.
- Fix internal `require` that broke the SDK with `underscore` 1.13 release.
- Update `@apify/storage-local` to v2 written in TypeScript.

1.1.1 / 2021/03/23
====================
- Fix `SessionPoolOptions` not being correctly used in `BrowserCrawler`.
- Improve error messages for missing `puppeteer` or `playwright` installations.

1.1.0 / 2021/03/19
====================
In this minor release we focused on the `SessionPool`. Besides fixing a few bugs, we added one important feature: setting and getting of sessions by ID.

```js
// Now you can add specific sessions to the pool,
// instead of relying on random generation.
await sessionPool.addSession({
    id: 'my-session',
    // ... some config
});

// Later, you can retrieve the session. This is useful
// for example when you need a specific login session.
const session = await sessionPool.getSession('my-session');
```

## Full list of changes:
- Add `sessionPool.addSession()` function to add a new session to the session pool (possibly with the provided options, e.g. with specific session id).
- Add optional parameter `sessionId` to `sessionPool.getSession()` to be able to retrieve a session from the session pool with the specific session id.
- Fix `SessionPool` not working properly in both `PuppeteerCrawler` and `PlaywrightCrawler`.
- Fix `Apify.call()` and `Apify.callTask()` output - make it backwards compatible with previous versions of the client.
- Improve handling of browser executable paths when using the official SDK Docker images.
- Update `browser-pool` to fix issues with failing hooks causing browsers to get stuck in limbo.
- Removed `proxy-chain` dependency because now it's covered in `browser-pool`.

1.0.2 / 2021/03/05
====================
- Add the ability to override `ProxyConfiguration` status check URL with the `APIFY_PROXY_STATUS_URL` env var.
- Fix inconsistencies in cookie handling when `SessionPool` was used.
- Fix TS types in multiple places. TS is still not a first class citizen, but this should improve the experience.

1.0.1 / 2021/02/03
====================
- Fix `dataset.pushData()` validation which would not allow other than plain objects.
- Fix `PuppeteerLaunchContext.stealth` throwing when used in `PuppeteerCrawler`.

1.0.0 / 2021/01/25
====================
After 3.5 years of rapid development and a lot of breaking changes and deprecations,
here comes the result - **Apify SDK v1**. There were two goals for this release. **Stability**
and **adding support for more browsers** - Firefox and Webkit (Safari).

The SDK has grown quite popular over the years, powering thousands of web scraping
and automation projects. We think our developers deserve a stable environment to work
in and by releasing SDK v1, **we commit to only make breaking changes once a year,
with a new major release**.

We added support for more browsers by replacing `PuppeteerPool` with
[`browser-pool`](https://github.com/apify/browser-pool). A new library that we created
specifically for this purpose. It builds on the ideas from `PuppeteerPool` and extends
them to support [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright). Playwright is
a browser automation library similar to Puppeteer. It works with all well known browsers
and uses almost the same interface as Puppeteer, while adding useful features and simplifying
common tasks. Don't worry, you can still use Puppeteer with the new `BrowserPool`.

A large breaking change is that neither `puppeteer` nor `playwright` are bundled with
the SDK v1. To make the choice of a library easier and installs faster, users will
have to install the selected modules and versions themselves. This allows us to add
support for even more libraries in the future.

Thanks to the addition of Playwright we now have a `PlaywrightCrawler`. It is very similar
to `PuppeteerCrawler` and you can pick the one you prefer. It also means we needed to make
some interface changes. The `launchPuppeteerFunction` option of `PuppeteerCrawler` is gone
and `launchPuppeteerOptions` were replaced by `launchContext`. We also moved things around
in the `handlePageFunction` arguments. See the
[migration guide](https://github.com/apify/apify-js/blob/master/MIGRATIONS.md)
for more detailed explanation and migration examples.

What's in store for SDK v2? We want to split the SDK into smaller libraries,
so that everyone can install only the things they need. We plan a TypeScript migration
to make crawler development faster and safer. Finally, we will take a good look
at the interface of the whole SDK and update it to improve the developer experience.
Bug fixes and scraping features will of course keep landing in versions 1.X as well.

## Full list of changes:
- **BREAKING:** Removed `puppeteer` from dependencies. If you want to use Puppeteer,
  you must install it yourself.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `PuppeteerPool`. Use [`browser-pool`](https://github.com/apify/browser-pool).
- **BREAKING:** Removed `PuppeteerCrawlerOptions.launchPuppeteerOptions`. Use `launchContext`.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `PuppeteerCrawlerOptions.launchPuppeteerFunction`.
  Use `PuppeteerCrawlerOptions.preLaunchHooks` and `postLaunchHooks`.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `args.autoscaledPool` and `args.puppeteerPool` from `handle(Page/Request)Function`
  arguments. Use `args.crawler.autoscaledPool` and `args.crawler.browserPool`.
- **BREAKING:** The `useSessionPool` and `persistCookiesPerSession` options of crawlers
  are now `true` by default. Explicitly set them to `false` to override the behavior.
- **BREAKING:** `Apify.launchPuppeteer()` no longer accepts `LaunchPuppeteerOptions`.
  It now accepts `PuppeteerLaunchContext`.

### New deprecations:
- **DEPRECATED:** `PuppeteerCrawlerOptions.gotoFunction`.
  Use `PuppeteerCrawlerOptions.preNavigationHooks` and `postNavigationHooks`.

### Removals of earlier deprecated functions:
- **BREAKING:** Removed `Apify.utils.puppeteer.enqueueLinks()`. Deprecated in 01/2019.
  Use `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks()`.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `autoscaledPool.(set|get)MaxConcurrency()`. Deprecated in 2019.
  Use `autoscaledPool.maxConcurrency`.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `CheerioCrawlerOptions.requestOptions`. Deprecated in 03/2020.
  Use `CheerioCrawlerOptions.prepareRequestFunction`.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `Launch.requestOptions`. Deprecated in 03/2020.
  Use `CheerioCrawlerOptions.prepareRequestFunction`.


### New features:
- Added `Apify.PlaywrightCrawler` which is almost identical to `PuppeteerCrawler`,
  but it crawls with the `playwright` library.
- Added `Apify.launchPlaywright(launchContext)` helper function.
- Added `browserPoolOptions` to `PuppeteerCrawler` to configure `BrowserPool`.
- Added `crawler` to `handle(Request/Page)Function` arguments.
- Added `browserController` to `handlePageFunction` arguments.
- Added `crawler.crawlingContexts` `Map` which includes all running `crawlingContext`s.

0.22.4 / 2021/01/10
====================
- Fix issues with `Apify.pushData()` and `keyValueStore.forEachKey()`
  by updating `@apify/storage-local` to `1.0.2`.

0.22.3 / 2021/01/09
====================
- Fix `puppeteerPool` missing in handle page arguments.

0.22.2 / 2020/12/22
====================
- Pinned `cheerio` to `1.0.0-rc.3` to avoid install problems in some builds.
- Increased default `maxEventLoopOverloadedRatio` in `SystemStatusOptions` to 0.6.
- Updated packages and improved docs.

0.22.1 / 2020/12/09
====================
This is the last major release before SDK v1.0.0. We're committed to deliver v1 at the
end of 2020 so stay tuned. Besides Playwright integration via a new `BrowserPool`,
it will be the first release of SDK that we'll support for an extended period of time.
We will not make any breaking changes until 2.0.0, which will come at the end of
2021. But enough about v1, let's see the changes in 0.22.0.

In this release we've changed a lot of code, but you may not even notice.
We've updated the underlying `apify-client` package which powers all communication with
the Apify API to version `1.0.0`. This means a completely new API for all internal calls.
If you use `Apify.client` calls in your code, this will be a large breaking change for you.
Visit the [client docs](https://github.com/apify/apify-client-js/blob/master/README.md)
to see what's new in the client, but also note that we removed the default client
available under `Apify.client` and replaced it with `Apify.newClient()` function.
We think it's better to have separate clients for users and internal use.

Until now, local emulation of Apify Storages has been a part of the SDK. We moved the logic
into a separate package `@apify/storage-local` which shares interface with `apify-client`.
`RequestQueue` is now powered by `SQLite3` instead of file system, which improves
reliability and performance quite a bit. `Dataset` and `KeyValueStore` still use file
system, for easy browsing of data. The structure of `apify_storage` folder remains unchanged.

After collecting common developer mistakes, we've decided to make argument validation stricter.
You will no longer be able to pass extra arguments to functions and constructors. This is
to alleviate frustration, when you mistakenly pass `useChrome` to `PuppeteerPoolOptions`
instead of `LaunchPuppeteerOptions` and don't realize it. Before this version, SDK wouldn't
let you know and would silently continue with Chromium. Now, it will throw an error saying
that `useChrome` is not an allowed property of `PuppeteerPoolOptions`.

Based on developer feedback, we decided to remove `--no-sandbox` from the default Puppeteer
launch args. It will only be used on Apify Platform. This gives you the chance to use
your own sandboxing strategy.

`LiveViewServer` and `puppeteerPoolOptions.useLiveView` were never very user-friendly
or performant solutions, due to the inherent performance issues with rapidly taking many
screenshots in Puppeteer. We've decided to remove it. If you need similar functionality,
try the `devtools-server` NPM package, which utilizes the Chrome DevTools Frontend for
screen-casting live view of the running browser.

Full list of changes:

- **BREAKING:** Updated `apify-client` to `1.0.0` with a completely new interface.
  We also removed the `Apify.client` property and replaced it with an `Apify.newClient()`
  function that creates a new `ApifyClient` instance.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `--no-sandbox` from default Puppeteer launch arguments.
  This will most likely be breaking for Linux and Docker users.
- **BREAKING:** Function argument validation is now more strict and will not accept extra
  parameters which are not defined by the functions' signatures.
- **DEPRECATED:** `puppeteerPoolOptions.useLiveView` is now deprecated.
  Use the `devtools-server` NPM package instead.

- Added `postResponseFunction` to `CheerioCrawlerOptions`. It allows you to override
  properties on the HTTP response before processing by `CheerioCrawler`.
- Added HTTP2 support to `utils.requestAsBrowser()`. Set `useHttp2` to `true`
  in `RequestAsBrowserOptions` to enable it.
- Fixed handling of XML content types in `CheerioCrawler`.
- Fixed capitalization of headers when using `utils.puppeteer.addInterceptRequestHandler`.
- Fixed `utils.puppeteer.saveSnapshot()` overwriting screenshots with HTML on local.
- Updated `puppeteer` to version `5.4.1` with Chrom(ium) 87.
- Removed `RequestQueueLocal` in favor of `@apify/storage-local` API emulator.
- Removed `KeyValueStoreLocal` in favor of `@apify/storage-local` API emulator.
- Removed `DatasetLocal` in favor of `@apify/storage-local` API emulator.
- Removed the `userData` option from `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks` (deprecated in Jun 2019).
  Use `transformRequestFunction` instead.
- Removed `instanceKillerIntervalMillis` and `killInstanceAfterMillis` (deprecated in Feb 2019).
  Use `instanceKillerIntervalSecs` and `killInstanceAfterSecs` instead.
- Removed the `memory` option from `Apify.call` `options` which was (deprecated in 2018).
  Use `memoryMbytes` instead.
- Removed `delete()` methods from `Dataset`, `KeyValueStore` and `RequestQueue` (deprecated in Jul 2019).
  Use `.drop()`.
- Removed `utils.puppeteer.hideWebDriver()` (deprecated in May 2019).
  Use `LaunchPuppeteerOptions.stealth`.
- Removed `utils.puppeteer.enqueueRequestsFromClickableElements()` (deprecated in 2018).
  Use `utils.puppeteer.enqueueLinksByClickingElements`.
- Removed `request.doNotRetry()` (deprecated in June 2019)
  Use `request.noRetry = true`.
- Removed `RequestListOptions.persistSourcesKey` (deprecated in Feb 2020)
  Use `persistRequestsKey`.
- Removed the `The function passed to Apify.main() threw an exception` error message,
  because it was confusing to users.
- Removed automatic injection of `charset=utf-8` in `keyValueStore.setValue()`
  to the `contentType` option.

0.22.0 / 2020/12/07
====================
- Technical release, see 0.22.1

0.21.11 / 2020/12/22
====================
- Pinned `cheerio` to `1.0.0-rc.3` to avoid install problems in some builds.

0.21.10 / 2020/12/07
====================
- Bump Puppeteer to 5.5.0 and Chrom(ium) 88.

0.21.9 / 2020/11/03
====================
- Fix various issues in `stealth`.
- Fix `SessionPool` not retiring sessions immediately when they become unusable.
  It fixes a problem where `PuppeteerPool` would not retire browsers wit bad sessions.

0.21.8 / 2020/10/07
====================
- Make `PuppeteerCrawler` safe against malformed Puppeteer responses.
- Update default user agent to Chrome 86
- Bump Puppeteer to 5.3.1 with Chromium 86

0.21.7 / 2020/10/03
====================
- Fix an error in `PuppeteerCrawler` caused by `page.goto()` randomly returning `null`.

0.21.6 / 2020/10/02
====================
It appears that `CheerioCrawler` was correctly retiring sessions on timeouts
and blocked status codes (401, 403, 429), whereas `PuppeteerCrawler` did not.
Apologies for the omission, this release fixes the problem.

- Fix sessions not being retired on blocked status codes in `PuppeteerCrawler`.
- Fix sessions not being marked bad on navigation timeouts in `PuppeteerCrawler`.
- Update `apify-shared` to version `0.5.0`.

0.21.5 / 2020/09/30
====================
This is a very minor release that fixes some issues that were preventing
use of the SDK with Node 14.

- Update the request serialization process which is used in `RequestList`
  to work with Node 10+.
- Update some TypeScript types that were preventing build due to changes
  in typed dependencies.

0.21.4 / 2020/09/02
====================
The statistics that you may remember from logs are now persisted in key-value store,
so you won't lose count when your actor restarts. We've also added a lot of useful
stats in there which can be useful to you after a run finishes. Besides that,
we fixed some bugs and annoyances and improved the TypeScript experience a bit.

- Add persistence to `Statistics` class and automatically persist it in `BasicCrawler`.
- Fix issue where inaccessible Apify Proxy would cause `ProxyConfiguration` to throw
  a timeout error.
- Update default user agent to Chrome 85
- Bump Puppeteer to 5.2.1 which uses Chromium 85

  as a return value from `requestQueue.getInfo()`

0.21.3 / 2020/07/27
====================
- Fix useless logging in Session.

0.21.2 / 2020/07/27
====================
- Fix cookies with leading dot in domain (as extracted from Puppeteer)
  not being correctly added to Sessions.

0.21.1 / 2020/07/21
====================
We fixed some bugs, improved a few things and bumped Puppeteer to match latest Chrome 84.

- Allow `Apify.createProxyConfiguration` to be used seamlessly with the proxy component
  of Actor Input UI.
- Fix integration of plugins into `CheerioCrawler` with the `crawler.use()` function.
- Fix a race condition which caused `RequestQueueLocal` to fail handling requests.
- Fix broken debug logging in `SessionPool`.
- Improve `ProxyConfiguration` error message for missing password / token.
- Update Puppeteer to 5.2.0
- Improve docs, update packages and so on.

0.21.0 / 2020/06/06
====================
This release comes with **breaking changes** that will affect most,
if not all of your projects. See the [migration guide](https://github.com/apifytech/apify-js/blob/master/MIGRATIONS.md)
for more information and examples.

First large change is a redesigned proxy configuration. `Cheerio` and `Puppeteer` crawlers
now accept a `proxyConfiguration` parameter, which is an instance of `ProxyConfiguration`.
This class now exclusively manages both Apify Proxy and custom proxies. Visit the new
[proxy management guide](https://sdk.apify.com/docs/guides/proxy-management)

We also removed `Apify.utils.getRandomUserAgent()` as it was no longer effective
in avoiding bot detection and changed the default values for empty properties in
`Request` instances.

- **BREAKING:** Removed `Apify.getApifyProxyUrl()`. To get an Apify Proxy url,
  use `proxyConfiguration.newUrl([sessionId])`.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `useApifyProxy`, `apifyProxyGroups` and `apifyProxySession` parameters
  from all applications in the SDK. Use `proxyConfiguration` in crawlers and `proxyUrl`
  in `requestAsBrowser` and `Apify.launchPuppeteer`.
- **BREAKING:** Removed `Apify.utils.getRandomUserAgent()` as it was no longer effective
  in avoiding bot detection.
- **BREAKING:** `Request` instances no longer initialize empty properties with `null`,
  which means that:
    - empty `errorMessages` are now represented by `[]`, and
    - empty `loadedUrl`, `payload` and `handledAt` are `undefined`.
- Add `Apify.createProxyConfiguration()` `async` function to create `ProxyConfiguration`
  instances. `ProxyConfiguration` itself is not exposed.
- Add `proxyConfiguration` to `CheerioCrawlerOptions`
  and `PuppeteerCrawlerOptions`.
- Add `proxyInfo` to `CheerioHandlePageInputs` and `PuppeteerHandlePageInputs`.
  You can use this object to retrieve information about the currently used proxy
  in `Puppeteer` and `Cheerio` crawlers.
- Add click buttons and scroll up options to `Apify.utils.puppeteer.infiniteScroll()`.
- Fixed a bug where intercepted requests would never continue.
- Fixed a bug where `Apify.utils.requestAsBrowser()` would get into redirect loops.
- Fix `Apify.utils.getMemoryInfo()` crashing the process on AWS Lambda and on systems
  running in Docker without memory cgroups enabled.
- Update Puppeteer to 3.3.0.

0.20.4 / 2020-05-11
====================
- Add `Apify.utils.waitForRunToFinish()` which simplifies waiting for an actor run to finish.
- Add standard prefixes to log messages to improve readability and orientation in logs.
- Add support for `async` handlers in `Apify.utils.puppeteer.addInterceptRequestHandler()`
- EXPERIMENTAL: Add `cheerioCrawler.use()` function to enable attaching `CrawlerExtension`
  to the crawler to modify its behavior. A plugin that extends functionality.
- Fix bug with cookie expiry in `SessionPool`.
- Fix issues in documentation.
- Updated `@apify/http-request` to fix issue in the `proxy-agent` package.
- Updated Puppeteer to 3.0.2

0.20.3 / 2020-04-14
====================
- **DEPRECATED:** `CheerioCrawlerOptions.requestOptions` is now deprecated. Please use
  `CheerioCrawlerOptions.prepareRequestFunction` instead.
- Add `limit` option to `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks()` for situations when full crawls are not needed.
- Add `suggestResponseEncoding` and `forceResponseEncoding` options to `CheerioCrawler` to allow
  users to provide a fall-back or forced encoding of responses in situations where websites
  serve invalid encoding information in their headers.
- Add a number of new examples and update existing ones to documentation.
- Fix duplicate file extensions in `Apify.utils.puppeteer.saveSnapshot()` when used locally.
- Fix encoding of multi-byte characters in `CheerioCrawler`.
- Fix formatting of navigation buttons in documentation.

0.20.2 / 2020-03-09
====================
- Fix an error where persistence of `SessionPool` would fail if a cookie included invalid
  `expires` value.
- Jumping a patch version because of an error in publishing via CI.

0.20.0 / 2020-03-03
====================
- **BREAKING:** `Apify.utils.requestAsBrowser()` no longer aborts request on status code 406
  or when other than `text/html` type is received. Use `options.abortFunction` if you want to
  retain this functionality.
- **BREAKING:** Added `useInsecureHttpParser` option to `Apify.utils.requestAsBrowser()` which
  is `true` by default and forces the function to use a HTTP parser that is less strict than
  default Node 12 parser, but also less secure. It is needed to be able to bypass certain
  anti-scraping walls and fetch websites that do not comply with HTTP spec.
- **BREAKING:** `RequestList` now removes all the elements from the `sources` array on
  initialization. If you need to use the sources somewhere else, make a copy. This change
  was added as one of several measures to improve memory management of `RequestList`
  in scenarios with very large amount of `Request` instances.
- **DEPRECATED:** `RequestListOptions.persistSourcesKey` is now deprecated. Please use
  `RequestListOptions.persistRequestsKey`.
- `RequestList.sources` can now be an array of `string` URLs as well.
- Added `sourcesFunction` to `RequestListOptions`. It enables dynamic fetching of sources
  and will only be called if persisted `Requests` were not retrieved from key-value store.
  Use it to reduce memory spikes and also to make sure that your sources are not re-created
  on actor restarts.
- Updated `stealth` hiding of `webdriver` to avoid recent detections.
- `Apify.utils.log` now points to an updated logger instance which prints colored logs (in TTY)
  and supports overriding with custom loggers.
- Improved `Apify.launchPuppeteer()` code to prevent triggering bugs in Puppeteer by passing
  more than required options to `puppeteer.launch()`.
- Documented `BasicCrawler.autoscaledPool` property, and added `CheerioCrawler.autoscaledPool`
  and `PuppeteerCrawler.autoscaledPool` properties.
- `SessionPool` now persists state on `teardown`. Before, it only persisted state every minute.
  This ensures that after a crawler finishes, the state is correctly persisted.
- Added TypeScript typings and typedef documentation for all entities used throughout SDK.
- Upgraded `proxy-chain` NPM package from 0.2.7 to 0.4.1 and many other dependencies
- Removed all usage of the now deprecated `request` package.

0.19.1 / 2020-01-30

  Use `APIFY_LOCAL_STORAGE_DIR` instead.
- `SessionPool` API updates and fixes. The API is no longer considered experimental.
- Logging of system info moved from `require` time to `Apify.main()` invocation.
- Use native `RegExp` instead of `xregexp` for unicode property escapes.

0.18.1 / 2020-01-06
====================
- Fix `SessionPool` not automatically working in `CheerioCrawler`.
- Fix incorrect management of page count in `PuppeteerPool`.

0.18.0 / 2020-01-06
====================
- **BREAKING** `CheerioCrawler` ignores ssl errors by default - `options.ignoreSslErrors: true`.
- Add `SessionPool` implemenation to `CheerioCrawler`.
- Add `SessionPool` implementation to `PuppeteerPool` and `PupeteerCrawler`.
- Fix `Request` constructor not making a copy of objects such as `userData` and `headers`.
- Fix `desc` option not being applied in local `dataset.getData()`.

0.17.0 / 2019-11-25
====================
- **BREAKING**: Node 8 and 9 are no longer supported. Please use Node 10.17.0 or higher.
- **DEPRECATED**: `Apify.callTask()` `body` and `contentType` options are now deprecated.
  Use `input` instead. It must be of `content-type: application/json`.
- Add default `SessionPool` implementation to `BasicCrawler`.
- Add the ability to create ad-hoc webhooks via `Apify.call()` and `Apify.callTask()`.
- Add an example of form filling with `Puppeteer`.
- Add `country` option to `Apify.getApifyProxyUrl()`.

  thus supporting things such as `cookieJar` again.
- Switch Puppeteer to web socket again due to suspected `pipe` errors.
- Fix an issue where some encodings were not correctly parsed in `CheerioCrawler`.

- Fix retry histogram statistics sometimes showing invalid counts.
- Added regexps for Youtube videos (`YOUTUBE_REGEX`, `YOUTUBE_REGEX_GLOBAL`) to `utils.social`
- Added documentation for option `json` in handlePageFunction of `CheerioCrawler`

0.16.1 / 2019-10-31
====================
- Bump Puppeteer to 2.0.0 and use `{ pipe: true }` again because upstream bug has been fixed.
- Add `useIncognitoPages` option to `PuppeteerPool` to enable opening new pages in incognito
  browser contexts. This is useful to keep cookies and cache unique for each page.
- Added options to load every content type in CheerioCrawler.
There are new options `body` and `contentType` in `handlePageFunction` for this purposes.
- **DEPRECATED**: CheerioCrawler `html` option in `handlePageFunction` was replaced with `body` options.

0.16.0 / 2019-08-15
====================
- This release updates `@apify/http-request` to version 1.1.2.

0.15.5 / 2019-08-15
====================
- This release just updates some dependencies (not Puppeteer).

0.15.4 / 2019-08-02
====================
- **DEPRECATED**: `dataset.delete()`, `keyValueStore.delete()` and `requestQueue.delete()` methods have been
  deprecated in favor of `*.drop()` methods, because the `drop` name more clearly communicates the fact
  that those methods drop / delete the storage itself, not individual elements in the storage.
- Added `Apify.utils.requestAsBrowser()` helper function that enables you to make HTTP(S) requests disguising
  as a browser (Firefox). This may help in overcoming certain anti-scraping and anti-bot protections.
- Added `options.gotoTimeoutSecs` to `PuppeteerCrawler` to enable easier setting of navigation timeouts.
- `PuppeteerPool` options that were deprecated from the `PuppeteerCrawler` constructor were finally removed.
  Please use `maxOpenPagesPerInstance`, `retireInstanceAfterRequestCount`, `instanceKillerIntervalSecs`,
  `killInstanceAfterSecs` and `proxyUrls` via the `puppeteerPoolOptions` object.
- On the Apify Platform a warning will now be printed when using an outdated `apify` package version.
- `Apify.utils.puppeteer.enqueueLinksByClickingElements()` will now print a warning when the nodes it
  tries to click become modified (detached from DOM). This is useful to debug unexpected behavior.

0.15.3 / 2019-07-29
====================
- `Apify.launchPuppeteer()` now accepts `proxyUrl` with the `https`, `socks4`
  and `socks5` schemes, as long as it doesn't contain username or password.
  This is to fix [Issue #420](https://github.com/apifytech/apify-js/issues/420).
- Added `desiredConcurrency` option to `AutoscaledPool` constructor, removed
  unnecessary bound check from the setter property

0.15.2 / 2019-07-11

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `Dataset.getData()` throws an error if user provides an unsupported option
  when using local disk storage.
- **DEPRECATED**: `options.userData` of `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks()` is deprecated.
  Use `options.transformRequestFunction` instead.
- Improve logging of memory overload errors.
- Improve error message in `Apify.call()`.
- Fix multiple log lines appearing when a crawler was about to finish.
- Add `Apify.utils.puppeteer.enqueueLinksByClickingElements()` function which enables you
  to add requests to the queue from pure JavaScript navigations, form submissions etc.
- Add `Apify.utils.puppeteer.infiniteScroll()` function which helps you with scrolling to the bottom
  of websites that auto-load new content.
- The `RequestQueue.handledCount()` function has been resurrected from deprecation,
  in order to have compatible interface with `RequestList`.
- Add `useExtendedUniqueKey` option to `Request` constructor to include `method` and `payload`
  in the `Request`'s computed `uniqueKey`.

0.14.12 / 2019-05-29
====================
- `Snapshotter` will now log critical memory overload warnings at most once per 10 seconds.

0.14.11 / 2019-05-28
====================
- Add `Statistics` class to track crawler run statistics.
- Use pipes instead of web sockets in Puppeteer to improve performance and stability.
- Add warnings to all functions using Puppeteer's request interception to inform users about
  its performance impact caused by automatic cache disabling.
- **DEPRECATED**: `Apify.utils.puppeteer.blockResources()` because of negative impact on performance.
  Use `.blockRequests()` (see below).
- Add `Apify.utils.puppeteer.blockRequests()` to enable blocking URL patterns without request interception involved.
  This is a replacement for `.blockResources()` until performance issues with request interception resolve.


0.14.10 / 2019-05-24
====================
- Update `Puppeteer` to 1.17.0.
- Add `idempotencyKey` parameter to `Apify.addWebhook()`.

0.14.9 / 2019-05-22
===================
- Better logs from `AutoscaledPool` class
- Replace `cpuInfo` Apify event with new `systemInfo` event in `Snapshotter`.

- Request queue now monitors number of clients that accessed the queue which allows crawlers to finish
  without 10s waiting if run was not migrated during its lifetime.


0.14.5 / 2019-05-06
===================
- Update Puppeteer to 1.15.0.

0.14.4 / 2019-05-06
===================

- **DEPRECATED**: `Apify.utils.puppeteer.hideWebDriver` use `launchPuppeteerOptions.stealth` instead.
- `CheerioCrawler` now parses HTML using streams. This improves performance and memory usage in most cases.

0.14.3 / 2019-05-06
===================
- Request queue now allows crawlers to finish quickly without waiting in a case that queue was used by a single client.
- Better logging of errors in `Apify.main()`

- New version of Live View is available by passing the `useLiveView = true` option to `PuppeteerPool`.
   - Only shows snapshots of a single page from a single browser.
   - Only makes snapshots when a client is connected, having very low performance impact otherwise.
- Added `Apify.utils.puppeteer.addInterceptRequestHandler` and `removeInterceptRequestHandler` which
  can be used to add multiple request interception handlers to Puppeteer's pages.
- Added `puppeteerModule` to `LaunchPuppeteerOptions` which enables use of other Puppeteer modules,
  such as `puppeteer-extra` instead of plain `puppeteer`.

0.13.7 / 2019-04-04
===================
- Fix a bug where invalid response from `RequestQueue` would occasionally cause crawlers to crash.

0.13.5 / 2019-03-27

0.13.1 / 2019-03-21
===================
- `Snapshotter` now marks Apify Client overloaded on the basis of 2nd retry errors.
- Added `Apify.addWebhook()` to invoke a webhook when an actor run ends.
  Currently this only works on the Apify Platform and will print a warning when ran locally.

0.13.0 / 2019-03-14
===================
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Added `puppeteerOperationTimeoutSecs` option to `PuppeteerPool`.
  It defaults to 15 seconds and all Puppeteer operations such as `browser.newPage()`
  or `puppeteer.launch()` will now time out. This is to prevent hanging requests.
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Added `handleRequestTimeoutSecs` option to `BasicCrawler` with a 60 second default.
- **DEPRECATED:** `PuppeteerPool` options in the `PuppeteerCrawler` constructor are now deprecated.
  Please use the new `puppeteerPoolOptions` argument of type `Object` to pass them. `launchPuppeteerFunction`
  and `launchPuppeteerOptions` are still available as shortcuts for convenience.
- `CheerioCrawler` and `PuppeteerCrawler` now automatically set `handleRequestTimeoutSecs` to 10 times
  their `handlePageTimeoutSecs`. This is a precaution that should keep requests from hanging forever.
- Added `options.prepareRequestFunction()` to `CheerioCrawler` constructor to enable modification
  of `Request` before the HTTP request is made to the target URL.
- Added back the `recycleDiskCache` option to `PuppeteerPool` now that it is supported

0.12.4 / 2019-03-05
===================
- Parameters `input` and `options` added to `Apify.callTask()`.

0.12.2 / 2019-02-27

  in order to prevent stalling crawlers.
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** `PseudoUrl` now performs case-insensitive matching, even for the query string part of the URLs.
  If you need case sensitive matching, use an appropriate `RegExp` in place of a Pseudo URL string
- **Upgraded to puppeteer@1.12.2** and xregexp@4.2.4

===================
- Apify SDK now logs basic system info when `required`.
- Added `utils.createRequestDebugInfo()` function to create a standardized debug info from request and response.
- `PseudoUrl` can now be constructed with a `RegExp`.
- `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks()` now accepts `RegExp` instances in its `pseudoUrls` parameter.
- `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks()` now accepts a `baseUrl` option that enables resolution of relative URLs
   when parsing a Cheerio object. (It's done automatically in browser when using Puppeteer).
- Better error message for an invalid `launchPuppeteerFunction` passed to `PuppeteerPool`.

0.11.6 / 2019-01-24
===================
- **DEPRECATION WARNING** `Apify.utils.puppeteer.enqueueLinks()` was moved to `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks()`.
- `Apify.utils.enqueueLinks()` now supports `options.$` property to enqueue links from a Cheerio object.

0.11.5 / 2019-01-18
===================
- Disabled the `PuppeteerPool` `reusePages` option for now, due to a memory leak.
- Added a `keyValueStore.forEachKey()` method to iterate all keys in the store.

0.11.4 / 2019-01-15
===================

===================
- Fix missing `autoscaledPool` parameter in `handlePageFunction` of `PuppeteerCrawler`.

0.11.0 / 2019-01-07
===================
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** `basicCrawler.abort()`, `cheerioCrawler.abort()` and `puppeteerCrawler.abort()` functions
  were removed in favor of a single `autoscaledPool.abort()` function.

- Added a reference to the running `AutoscaledPool` instance to the options object of `BasicCrawler`'s
  `handleRequestFunction` and to the `handlePageFunction` of `CheerioCrawler` and `PuppeteerCrawler`.
- Added sources persistence option to `RequestList` that works best in conjunction with the state persistence,
  but can be toggled separately too.
- Added `Apify.openRequestList()` function to place it in line with `RequestQueue`, `KeyValueStore` and `Dataset`.
  `RequestList` created using this function will automatically persist state and sources.
- Added `pool.pause()` and `pool.resume()` functions to `AutoscaledPool`. You can now pause the pool,
  which will prevent additional tasks from being run and wait for the running ones to finish.
- Fixed a memory leak in `CheerioCrawler` and potentially other crawlers.

0.10.2 / 2018-12-30
===================
- Added `Apify.utils.htmlToText()` function to convert HTML to text and removed unncessary `html-to-text` dependency.
  The new function is now used in `Apify.utils.social.parseHandlesFromHtml()`.
- Updated `DEFAULT_USER_AGENT`

0.10.0 / 2018-12-19
===================
- `autoscaledPool.isFinishedFunction()` and `autoscaledPool.isTaskReadyFunction()` exceptions
  will now cause the `Promise` returned by `autoscaledPool.run()` to reject instead of just
  logging a message. This is in line with the `autoscaledPool.runTaskFunction()` behavior.
- Bugfix: PuppeteerPool was incorrectly overriding `proxyUrls` even if they were not defined.
- Fixed an issue where an error would be thrown when `datasetLocal.getData()` was invoked
  with an overflowing offset. It now correctly returns an empty `Array`.
- Added the `reusePages` option to `PuppeteerPool`. It will now reuse existing tabs
  instead of opening new ones for each page when enabled.
- `BasicCrawler` (and therefore all Crawlers) now logs a message explaining why it finished.
- Fixed an issue where `maxRequestsPerCrawl` option would not be honored after restart or migration.
- Fixed an issue with timeout promises that would sometimes keep the process hanging.
- `CheerioCrawler` now accepts `gzip` and `deflate` compressed responses.

0.9.15 / 2018-11-30
===================
- Upgraded Puppeteer to 1.11.0
- **DEPRECATION WARNING:** `Apify.utils.puppeteer.enqueueLinks()` now uses an options object instead of individual parameters
  and supports passing of `userData` to the enqueued `request`. Previously: `enqueueLinks(page, selector, requestQueue, pseudoUrls)`
  Now: `enqueueLinks({ page, selector, requestQueue, pseudoUrls, userData })`. Using individual parameters is **DEPRECATED**.

0.9.14 / 2018-11-27
===================
- Added API response tracking to AutoscaledPool, leveraging `Apify.client.stats` object. It now overloads the system
  when a large amount of  429 - Too Many Requests is received.
