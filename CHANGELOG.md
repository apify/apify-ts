## [3.0.0](https://github.com/apify/apify-ts/compare/v2.3.2...master) (TBA)

### Features

* TS rewrite
* monorepo split...

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `Apify.call()` is now just a shortcut for running `ApifyClient.actor(actorId).call(input, options)`, while also taking the token inside env vars into account
* `Apify.callTask()` is now just a shortcut for running `ApifyClient.task(taskId).call(input, options)`, while also taking the token inside env vars into account
* `Apify.metamorph()` is now just a shortcut for running `ApifyClient.task(taskId).metamorph(input, options)`, while also taking the ACTOR_RUN_ID inside env vars into account
* `Apify.waitForRunToFinish()` has been removed, use `ApifyClient.waitForFinish()` instead
* (internal) `QueueOperationInfo.request` is no longer available
* (internal) `Request.handledAt` is now string date in ISO format
* (perf/internal) `Request.inProgress` and `Request.reclaimed` are now `Set`s instead of dictionaries
* `injectUnderscore` from puppeteer utils has been removed
* some `AutoscaledPool` options are no longer available:
  * `cpuSnapshotIntervalSecs` and `memorySnapshotIntervalSecs` has been replaced with top level `systemInfoIntervalMillis` configuration
  * `maxUsedCpuRatio` has been moved to the top level configuration
* `ProxyConfiguration.newUrlFunction` can be async. `.newUrl()` and `.newProxyInfo()` now return promises.
* stealth mode has been removed in favour of fingerprints and fingerprints are now enabled by default
* `prepareRequestFunction` and `postResponseFunction` options are removed, use navigation hooks instead
* `gotoFunction` and `gotoTimeoutSecs` are removed
* removed compatibility fix for old/broken request queues with null Request props
* `Actor.main/init` purges the storage by default
* remove `purgeLocalStorage` helper, move purging to the storage class directly
  * `StorageClient` interface now has optional `purge` method
  * purging happens automatically via `Actor.init()` (you can opt out via `purge: false` in the options of `init/main` methods)
* `Session#getPuppeteerCookies` and `Session#setPuppeteerCookies` have been renamed to `Session#getCookies` and `Session#setCookies` respectively.
* The default `maxConcurrency` for AutoscaledPool has been lowered to 200 from 1000.
  * This means the default `maxConcurrency` for all crawlers is also 200 now.
* For BrowserPool users, you can no longer mix and match different browser plugin types (for example you can no longer have a pool with puppeteer and playwright plugins in it). Instead, it's expected that all plugins present will match the same class as the first plugin provided.

## [2.3.2](https://github.com/apify/apify-ts/compare/v2.3.1...v2.3.2) (2022-05-05)

* fix: use default user agent for playwright with chrome instead of the default "headless UA"
* fix: always hide webdriver of chrome browsers

## [2.3.1](https://github.com/apify/apify-ts/compare/v2.3.0...v2.3.1) (2022-05-03)

* feat: `utils.playwright.injectJQuery()` (#1337)
* feat: add `keyValueStore` option to `Statistics` class (#1345)
* fix: ensure failed req count is correct when using `RequestList` (#1347)
* fix: random puppeteer crawler (running in headful mode) failure (#1348)
  > This should help with the `We either navigate top level or have old version of the navigated frame` bug in puppeteer.
* fix: allow returning falsy values in `RequestTransform`'s return type

## [2.3.0](https://github.com/apify/apify-ts/compare/v2.2.2...v2.3.0) (2022-04-07)

* feat: requestList accepts proxyConfiguration for requestsFromUrls (#1317)
* feat: update `playwright` to v1.20.2
* feat: update `puppeteer` to v13.5.2
  > We noticed that with this version of puppeteer actor run could crash with
  > `We either navigate top level or have old version of the navigated frame` error
  > (puppeteer issue [here](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/7050)).
  > It should not happen while running the browser in headless mode.
  > In case you need to run the browser in headful mode (`headless: false`),
  > we recommend pinning puppeteer version to `10.4.0` in actor `package.json` file.
* feat: stealth deprecation (#1314)
* feat: allow passing a stream to KeyValueStore.setRecord (#1325)
* fix: use correct apify-client instance for snapshotting (#1308)

* fix: improve guessing of chrome executable path on windows (#1294)
* fix: prune CPU snapshots locally (#1313)
* fix: improve browser launcher types (#1318)

### 0 concurrency mitigation

This release should resolve the 0 concurrency bug by automatically resetting the
internal `RequestQueue` state after 5 minutes of inactivity.

We now track last activity done on a `RequestQueue` instance:

* added new request
* started processing a request (added to `inProgress` cache)
* marked request as handled
* reclaimed request

If we don't detect one of those actions in last 5 minutes, and we have some
requests in the `inProgress` cache, we try to reset the state. We can override
this limit via `CRAWLEE_INTERNAL_TIMEOUT` env var.

This should finally resolve the 0 concurrency bug, as it was always about
stuck requests in the `inProgress` cache.

## [2.2.2](https://github.com/apify/apify-ts/compare/v2.2.1...v2.2.2) (2022-02-14)

* fix: ensure `request.headers` is set
* fix: lower `RequestQueue` API timeout to 30 seconds
* improve logging for fetching next request and timeouts

## [2.2.1](https://github.com/apify/apify-ts/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1) (2022-01-03)

* fix: ignore requests that are no longer in progress (#1258)
* fix: do not use `tryCancel()` from inside sync callback (#1265)
* fix: revert to puppeteer 10.x (#1276)
* fix: wait when `body` is not available in `infiniteScroll()` from Puppeteer utils (#1238)
* fix: expose logger classes on the `utils.log` instance (#1278)

## [2.2.0](https://github.com/apify/apify-ts/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0) (2021-12-17)

### Proxy per page

Up until now, browser crawlers used the same session (and therefore the same proxy) for
all request from a single browser * now get a new proxy for each session. This means
that with incognito pages, each page will get a new proxy, aligning the behaviour with
`CheerioCrawler`.

This feature is not enabled by default. To use it, we need to enable `useIncognitoPages`
flag under `launchContext`:

```ts
new Apify.Playwright({
    launchContext: {
        useIncognitoPages: true,
    },
    // ...
})
```

> Note that currently there is a performance overhead for using `useIncognitoPages`.
> Use this flag at your own will.

We are planning to enable this feature by default in SDK v3.0.

### Abortable timeouts

Previously when a page function timed out, the task still kept running. This could lead to requests being processed multiple times. In v2.2 we now have abortable timeouts that will cancel the task as
early as possible.

### Mitigation of zero concurrency issue

Several new timeouts were added to the task function, which should help mitigate the zero concurrency bug. Namely fetching of next request information and reclaiming failed requests back to the queue
are now executed with a timeout with 3 additional retries before the task fails. The timeout is always at least 300s (5 minutes), or `requestHandlerTimeoutSecs` if that value is higher.

## [2.0.4](https://github.com/apify/apify-ts/compare/v2.0.3...v2.0.4) (2021-08-23)

* Use `sessionToken` with `got-scraping`

## [2.0.3](https://github.com/apify/apify-ts/compare/v2.0.2...v2.0.3) (2021-08-20)

* **BREAKING IN EDGE CASES** * We removed `forceUrlEncoding` in `requestAsBrowser` because we found out that recent versions of the underlying HTTP client `got` already encode URLs
  and `forceUrlEncoding` could lead to weird behavior. We think of this as fixing a bug, so we're not bumping the major version.
* Limit `handleRequestTimeoutMillis` to max valid value to prevent Node.js fallback to `1`.
* Use `got-scraping@^3.0.1`
* Disable SSL validation on MITM proxie
* Limit `handleRequestTimeoutMillis` to max valid value

## [2.0.2](https://github.com/apify/apify-ts/compare/v2.0.1...v2.0.2) (2021-08-12)

* Fix serialization issues in `CheerioCrawler` caused by parser conflicts in recent versions of `cheerio`.

## [2.0.1](https://github.com/apify/apify-ts/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1) (2021-08-06)

* Use `got-scraping` 2.0.1 until fully compatible.

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/apify/apify-ts/compare/v1.3.4...v2.0.0) (2021-08-05)

* **BREAKING**: Require Node.js >=15.10.0 because HTTP2 support on lower Node.js versions is very buggy.
* **BREAKING**: Bump `cheerio` to `1.0.0-rc.10` from `rc.3`. There were breaking changes in `cheerio` between the versions so this bump might be breaking for you as well.
* Remove `LiveViewServer` which was deprecated before release of SDK v1.
